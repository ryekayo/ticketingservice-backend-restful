Ticketing System Implementing RESTful Service

The RESTful ticketing service will be used as a modern customer service ticketing system. The technologies I have used for this is Spring/Hibernate.

This project consists of four layers: Entities, DAOs (Data Access Objects), Service, and WS. 

The Entities will map out the database in Hibernate and will describe the relationships of each table (Foreign Keys, columns, etc.)
The DAOs will allow SELECT and JOIN statements in the database.
The Service will allow for INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs in the database.
The WS is the webservice calls that are made in the web application.
